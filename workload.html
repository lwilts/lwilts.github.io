    <h1>Workloads, Applications, and Services</h1>

    <h2>What’s in a name?</h2>

    <p>In the fast-moving and often confusing world of technology and IT, we’re used to words having multiple meanings
        and interpretations. Every organisation has varying terminology, and many words we use daily have very different
        meanings in different contexts.</p>

    <p>Three prime examples of this are <strong>“workload”</strong>, <strong>“application”</strong> and
        <strong>“service”</strong>, which come up a lot when we discuss cloud migration.</p>

    <p>Let’s look at some of the available definitions of these.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Workload</h2>

    <blockquote>“The amount of work to be done, especially by a particular person or machine in a period of time.”<br>—
        <em>Cambridge Dictionary</em></blockquote>

    <p>This generic definition implies a rate of work rather than a single complete task, which differs from what we
        might think of as a <strong>computing workload</strong>.</p>

    <blockquote>“Any program or application that runs on any computer.”<br>— <em>techtarget.com</em></blockquote>

    <p>This might be a <strong>finite process</strong>, such as a batch processing job, or a <strong>long-running
            one</strong>, such as an operating system.</p>

    <p>In the cloud era, the definition evolves. According to AWS:</p>

    <blockquote>“A collection of resources and code that delivers business value, such as a customer-facing application
        or a backend process.”</blockquote>

    <p>This is broader, but it makes sense in a cloud environment where compute, networking, and storage are all
        virtualised. A database might be a workload in itself, but when tightly coupled with a frontend interface, we
        could call this one workload.</p>

    <h2>Application</h2>

    <blockquote>“A computer program that is designed for a particular purpose.”<br>— <em>Cambridge Dictionary</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This sounds similar to our computing definition of a workload. The key differentiator seems to be the notion of
        <strong>“purpose”</strong>.</p>

    <p>We often prepend the word <strong>application</strong> (or <strong>app</strong>) with a purpose: <em>email</em>,
        <em>banking</em>, <em>dating</em>, <em>backup</em>.</p>

    <p>This definition scales across different situations:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A mobile app</li>
        <li>A backend system (e.g., inventory or CMS)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A modern application might just be one component—like a frontend—that connects to other applications, often via
        APIs.</p>

    <h3>Distinguishing Applications from Workloads</h3>

    <p>A good way to distinguish the two:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A <strong>developer writes an application</strong> (code stored in GitHub or published to an app store).
        </li>
        <li>It becomes a <strong>workload when it’s run somewhere</strong>—a VM, laptop, phone, or Kubernetes cluster.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Service</h2>

    <p>If you’re a Linux sysadmin, a service is:</p>

    <blockquote>“An application (or set of applications) that runs in the background waiting to be used, or carrying out
        essential tasks.”<br>— <em>linux.com</em></blockquote>

    <p>We know how to create <strong>services</strong> using <code>systemd</code> to keep programs running.</p>

    <p>At the other end of the spectrum, when discussing user-facing systems:</p>

    <blockquote>“Something that helps [the user] to do something – like learn to drive, buy a house, or become a
        childminder.”<br>— <em>Government Digital Service</em></blockquote>

    <p>These <strong>human-facing services</strong> require considerations for user experience and UI design.</p>

    <p>In cloud computing, we also hear terms like:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS)</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here, the user gets an interface without needing to run or configure the underlying systems.</p>

    <blockquote>“A mechanism to enable access to one or more capabilities.”<br>— <em>OASIS</em></blockquote>

    <p>This leans toward the <strong>access mechanism</strong> itself being the "service"—arguably accurate in
        <code>systemd</code> and Kubernetes contexts.</p>

    <p>But in the <strong>government service</strong> sense, a service tends to include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The <strong>user journey</strong></li>
        <li>The <strong>apps</strong> used along the way</li>
        <li>The <strong>workloads</strong> that support those apps</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Microservices</h2>

    <p>Now, let’s throw a spanner in the works and talk about <strong>microservices</strong>.</p>

    <blockquote>
        Microservices – or microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a
        collection of services that are:
        <ul>
            <li>Highly maintainable and testable</li>
            <li>Loosely coupled</li>
            <li>Independently deployable</li>
            <li>Organised around business capabilities</li>
            <li>Owned by a small team</li>
        </ul>
        — <a href="https://microservices.io">microservices.io</a>
    </blockquote>

    <p>An application built with microservices is composed of several <strong>underlying services</strong>, each serving
        a distinct purpose via an API.</p>

    <p>Each of these microservices could be:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Considered an <strong>application</strong> in its own right</li>
        <li>Referred to as a <strong>workload</strong> when deployed (e.g. containers, DB, config)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But is a microservice a <strong>“service”</strong> in the user experience or government sense? <strong>Absolutely
            not.</strong></p>

    <h2>Workload Migration</h2>

    <p><strong>Workloads</strong> are what we at AL prefer to discuss when carrying out <strong>cloud
            migrations</strong> — after all, if you aren’t running your applications somewhere, they aren’t providing
        much value.</p>

    <p>Typically, a workload is the <strong>minimum viable unit</strong> for migration because it includes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The application</li>
        <li>Supporting resources (e.g., storage, networking)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Workloads are what underpin the <strong>business value</strong> of a system.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, several related workloads are grouped into a <strong>migration group</strong> based on:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Connectivity</li>
        <li>Latency</li>
        <li>Security</li>
        <li>Shared deployment patterns</li>
    </ul>

    <p>How we plan and execute these migrations — based on business needs, workload characteristics, and source/target
        environments — is a large topic for another article.</p>

    <h2>Concluding thoughts</h2>

    <p>In many ways, <strong>workloads</strong>, <strong>applications</strong>, and <strong>services</strong> are just
        different sides of the same (geometrically improbable) coin.</p>

    <p>The subtle differences:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A <strong>workload</strong> is an <em>instantiation</em> of an application.</li>
        <li>A <strong>service</strong> is how that capability is <em>consumed</em>, by a user or another system.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There’s a <strong>fractal-like pattern</strong> to these terms:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Top level: a user interacts with a <strong>service</strong> → via an <strong>application</strong> → backed
            by a <strong>workload</strong>.</li>
        <li>Zoom in: the application may include other applications, services, and workloads.</li>
        <li>Zoom in further: code-level functions or modules could be seen as workloads by a developer.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Essentially — it’s all relative!</strong></p>

    <h2>Final Definitions</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Workload</strong>: A tightly coupled group of resources which run and support an application or
            capability.</li>
        <li><strong>Application</strong>: A piece of software which fulfils a specific purpose.</li>
        <li><strong>Service</strong>: The means of facilitating interactions with a workload in order to utilise its
            capabilities and fulfil a job to be done.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Ultimately, what matters is that what you create provides <strong>business value</strong>. It’s very difficult to
        use terminology in a completely consistent way, but that’s OK — as long as users get value, and teams can
        collaborate with shared meaning to generate that value.</p>
